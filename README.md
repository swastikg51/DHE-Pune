# Problem Statement :- 
The Directorate of Higher Education has 7 Government Colleges and 26 aided colleges under it. Altogether, more than 10000 students that pass out from them every year either choose to opt for further studies, work or have their own startups. Currently, there is no mechanism for the colleges and the Directorate to keep a track of the students passing out. Hence, the problem is to develop a web based application for colleges and the Directorate to keep a track of the Alumni. 


# Approach details :- 
- Our plan includes the creation of a portal where institutions and the Department of Higher Education can view current professions of alumni students.
- Alumni members should be able to register on their own.
- Enabling colleges to verify and authenticate their alumni.
- Alumni members have the option to update their information.
- Along with connecting students with institutes, the platform also allows members to participate in group discussions.
- Allow universities to search for information using parameters such as year, stream.
- Allow DEH administration to look for information based on criteria like colleges, year, and stream.
- The university and the administrator can send messages and emails to alumni members.
- Institutes can also arrange events and post alerts on the site.
- The platform's main focus is on security features, such as secured authentication and authorization of members, as well as data confidentiality.
